# Ising models in ecology

*Applying Ising models to spatial patterns in ecology*

Spatial patterns in ecology, specifically the scaling of occupied patches and the spatial distribution of abundances, show regularity across systems, yet a synthetic theory to predict this regularity continues to elude us.  Ising models in physics have been an incredibly useful platform to generate universal predictions across systems and understand the origin of commonalities across systems.  Here we apply Ising models to the distribution of individuals across space to better understand the universal statistical processes leading to observed patterns.
